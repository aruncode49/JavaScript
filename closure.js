// üëâüèª Definition 1 : A closure is the closed-over variable enviourment of the execution context in which a function was created, even after that execution context is gone;

// üëâüèª Definition 2 : A closure gives a function access to all the variables of its parent function, even after that parent function has returned. The function keeps a reference to its outer scope, which preserves the scope chain throughout time.

// üëâüèª Definition 1 : A closure makes sure that a function does'nt loose connection to variables that existed at the function's birth place;

// üìù Note : We do not have to manually create closures, this is a javascript feature that happens automatically. We can't even access closed-over variables explicitly. A closure is NOT a tangible javascript object.
